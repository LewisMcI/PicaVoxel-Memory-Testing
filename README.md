# PicaVoxel-Memory-Testing

These files include a list of models found online, using [Drububu's Voxelizer](https://drububu.com/miscellaneous/voxelizer/?out=vox), each of these models were converted to 128x128x128 and 256x256x256 voxel grids. 

The files include.
- Four models of varying aesthetical type, with its polygonal model, 128x128x128 voxel grid, and 256x256x256 voxel grid.
- A method of finding average frame per second, utilising the GUIFramerate.cs.
- The memory profiler, used to gather data analytics for memory footprint.
